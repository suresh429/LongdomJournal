He obtained his MD-PhD degrees at Cornell University Medical School. From 1992-97, he was a Fellow at the Whitehead Institute at MIT, affiliated with Dr. Harvey Lodish&rsquo;s laboratory. His work at Whitehead/MIT was the first to establish the role of caveolae and caveolins in signal transduction. Later, as a Professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, his laboratory was the first to develop caveolin-knock-out mice (for the Cav-1, Cav-2, and Cav-3 gene). Caveolin is a structural protein component of caveolae, invaginations of the plasma membrane found in most cell types. Caveolin acts as a scaffolding protein to concentrate, organize, and functionally regulate signaling molecules within caveolar membranes. The caveolin gene family consists of three members: caveolin-1,-2, and -3.\r\n\\r\\nFinally, Dr. Lisanti is the Chair of the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University.

A loss of either one of these processes can lead to a loss of vision. My lab is focused on understanding the roles of a large family of proteins, known as the TGF-Beta family of growth factors, in the differentiation and patterning of the vertebrate eye. We are using tools such as microinjection of retroviruses carrying transgenes into the developing eye, as well as addition of factors in vitro to retinal cultures to perturb growth factor signaling to assay effects on differentiation as well as axonal and dendritic outgrowth.
